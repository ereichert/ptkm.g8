# An example controller showing a sample home page
GET     /                           controllers.HomeController.index

# Provides JavaScripts access to the autogenerated jsRoutes methods.
# This doesn't make me particularly happy as I think these methods should be
# made available as static assets. This is the best option at the moment however.
GET     /assets/jsroutes                        controllers.JsRoutesController.jsRoutes

# Map static resources from the /public folder to the /assets URL path
GET     /assets/*file               controllers.Assets.versioned(path="/public", file: Asset)
